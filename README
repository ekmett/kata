Build Instructions
------------------

The root directory of the project contains the SBT launcher, shell script, and Windows command script.

This is the directory structure of the build.

|- project +
|          |-build +
|          |       |- kata.scala             Project Definition, containing module structure, compiler
|          |       |                         options, cross module dependencies, etc.
|          |       |- build.properties       Version of SBT, Scala, and Kata
|          |                                 A different version of Scala is used to run SBT and compile
|          |                                 the Project Definition than is used to compile Kata
|          |-target                          Compiled Project Definition
|          |
|          +-boot                            Versions of Scala Compiler and Library.

|-src   +
|       |-main +
|       |      |-scala            Source files
|       |
|       |-test +
|              |-scala            Test source files
|
|-lib_managed                     Managed Dependencies for this module, e.g. Scalacheck.
|
|-target +
         |- <scala version M>    All built artifacts (classes, jars, scaladoc) for module N
                                 built for version M of Scala.

1. ./sbt update (this step is required after a fresh checkout, after changing the version of
                 SBT, Scala, or other dependencies)
2. ./sbt [compile | package | test-compile | test | publish-local | publish]

For continuous compilation:

$ ./sbt
> ~ compile
